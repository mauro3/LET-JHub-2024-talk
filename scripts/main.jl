  - assignments and solutions
  - web-pages
- to show you how we use (interactive) computing exercises in our lectures.

# Teaching conclusions

- all the content (slides, exercise, exercise solution) you saw today is generated from the two script
  - this keeps things simple when doing and updating exercises
  - simple system of tags to generate different content
  - how the PDE-on-GPU lecture operates, also its website generated like this
  - how parts of Physics of Glaciers lecture operates
- should be possible with other programming languages and a literate-type programming package
- integration with Moodle pretty good
